Mal, to provide me with the opportunity to work on this exciting work. Also, I also want to thank my supervisor for his enthusiasm, support, encouragement, and patience, which help me to complete this project.\\

Furthermore, I would like to express special gratitude to Prafulla Saha, without whose assistance this work remains uncompleted.  I also want to thank Chandiprashad Kar for his assistance and a healthy discussion over the doubts in the course of this project. Throughout this project, these people help me to clarify the problem and make it simpler for me to understand the reasoning behind the processes. I also want to thank other lab members, Aloke Kr. Das, Priyanka Sadangi, Lipsarani Panda, and other members for making a wonderful lab environment.\\
